# A basic smart contract: the Mood Setter/Getter, moodSG

## The what ... What it does
A smart contract that gets and sets mood! 

First sets a mood and then gets it. (You can only reap what you sow ha???). Simply, it first stores something on a blockchain (how?, which blockchain?, ...???) then gets it back (hw???) 

## Features

Any???

## Components
<ul>
    <li>The smart contract</li>
        <ul>
            <li>the solidity contract: set & get 'mood'</li>
            <li>located/deployed on Goerli Testnet</li>
            <li>written/coded/compiled & deployed to the testnet from Remix</li>
            <li>... and what a hell is this .... ?(Be sure to deploy on Goerli via Remix under the Injected Provider - MetaMask environment and confirm the deployment transaction in Metamask) as found as learn from learnweb3??? .... what is the real role of Metamask here??? ..... in a clear langauge! (as we already know how to code/compile/deploy (from a remix/or to testnet bc!) & access the contract)</li>
            <li> .... So, MetaMask will be our wallet. But more than that, its also offering a 'proxy to a blockchain node'. And it does this, by injecting itself as a 'web3 Provider into a website'.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>A web page to access the smart constract ... on a central server or where???</li>
    <li>An Ether to connect the above ... how the hell??? What is it this ether.js thing anyway???</li>
</ul>
